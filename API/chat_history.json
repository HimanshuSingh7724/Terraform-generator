This effectively reverses the string. `\\\"12345\\\"[::-1]` becomes `\\\"54321\\\"`.\\n*   For negative numbers like `-876`, `s[:0:-1]` reverses everything *except* the first character (the `-` sign).\\n*   `int()` converts the reversed string back into a number. Note that `int(\\\"021\\\")` correctly becomes `21`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Method 2: Using a Mathematical Approach (with a `while` loop)\\n\\nThis method doesn\\'t use string conversion and relies on arithmetic operations. It\\'s a classic approach often asked about in programming interviews to test your logical thinking.\\n\\n```python\\ndef reverse_number_loop(n):\\n  \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n  Reverses an integer using a while loop and arithmetic.\\n  \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n  original_num = n\\n  reversed_num = 0\\n  \\n  # Work with the absolute value for the loop\\n  if n < 0:\\n      n = -n\\n      \\n  while n > 0:\\n    # 1. Get the last digit\\n    digit = n % 10\\n    \\n    # 2. Append the digit to the reversed number\\n    reversed_num = (reversed_num * 10) + digit\\n    \\n    # 3. Remove the last digit from the original number\\n    n = n // 10\\n    \\n  # Re-apply the negative sign if the original number was negative\\n  if original_num < 0:\\n      return -reversed_num\\n  else:\\n      return reversed_num\\n\\n# --- Example Usage ---\\nnum1 = 12345\\nnum2 = -876\\nnum3 = 120\\n\\nprint(f\\\"The reverse of {num1} is: {reverse_number_loop(num1)}\\\")\\nprint(f\\\"The reverse of {num2} is: {reverse_number_loop(num2)}\\\")\\nprint(f\\\"The reverse of {num3} is: {reverse_number_loop(num3)}\\\")\\n```\\n\\n**Output:**\\n```\\nThe reverse of 12345 is: 54321\\nThe reverse of -876 is: -678\\nThe reverse of 120 is: 21\\n```\\n\\n**How it works (using 123 as an example):**\\n\\n1.  **Initialize:** `n = 123`, `reversed_num = 0`.\\n2.  **Loop 1:**\\n    *   `digit = 123 % 10`  (gives `3`)\\n    *   `reversed_num = (0 * 10) + 3` (gives `3`)\\n    *   `n = 123 // 10` (gives `12`)\\n3.  **Loop 2:**\\n    *   `digit = 12 % 10`  (gives `2`)\\n    *   `reversed_num = (3 * 10) + 2` (gives `32`)\\n    *   `n = 12 // 10` (gives `1`)\\n4.  **Loop 3:**\\n    *   `digit = 1 % 10`  (gives `1`)\\n    *   `reversed_num = (32 * 10) + 1` (gives `321`)\\n    *   `n = 1 // 10` (gives `0`)\\n5.  **End Loop:** The loop terminates because `n` is now `0`. The final `reversed_num` is `321`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Full Program with User Input\\n\\nHere\\'s how you can put it all together in a script that asks the user for a number.\\n\\n```python\\ndef reverse_number(n):\\n  \\\"\\\"\\\"A robust function to reverse a number using the string slicing method.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n  s = str(n)\\n  if s.startswith(\\'-\\'):\\n    return int(\\'-\\' + s[1:][::-1])\\n  else:\\n    return int(s[::-1])\\n\\n# --- Main part of the script ---\\ntry:\\n  user_input = input(\\\"Enter a number to reverse: \\\")\\n  number = int(user_input)\\n  reversed_n = reverse_number(number)\\n  print(f\\\"The reversed number is: {reversed_n}\\\")\\n\\nexcept ValueError:\\n  print(\\\"Invalid input. Please enter an integer.\\\")\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Which method should you use?\\n\\n*   For everyday Python programming, the **string slicing method (Method 1)** is preferred. It\\'s more readable, concise, and considered more \\\"Pythonic\\\".\\n*   For technical interviews or situations where you need to demonstrate algorithmic thinking without relying on built-in string functions, the **loop method (Method 2)** is an excellent choice.\"\n}\nrole: \"model\"\n",

    "bot": "Of course! Here are a few ways to write Python code to reverse a number, from the simplest to a more robust solution that handles edge cases.\n\n### 1. The Simple & \"Pythonic\" Way (Using String Slicing)\n\nThis is the most common and concise way to do it in Python. The idea is to convert the number to a string, reverse the string, and then convert it back to an integer.\n\n```python\n# Get input from the user\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n# Convert number to string, reverse it, and convert back to integer\nreversed_num = int(str(num)[::-1])\n\nprint(\"The reversed number is:\", reversed_num)\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n1.  `str(num)`: Converts the number (e.g., `12345`) into a string (`\"12345\"`).\n2.  `[::-1]`: This is a special \"slice\" notation in Python that reverses a sequence (like a string). So, `\"12345\"` becomes `\"54321\"`.\n3.  `int(...)`: Converts the reversed string (`\"54321\"`) back into an integer (`54321`).\n\n**Limitation:** This simple method fails for negative numbers (e.g., `-123` becomes `321-`, which causes an error when converting to an `int`). It also drops trailing zeros (e.g., `120` becomes `21`), which is the correct mathematical behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Algorithmic Way (Using a `while` loop)\n\nThis method uses math (modulo and division) and is a great way to understand the underlying logic. It's a common question in programming interviews.\n\n```python\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nreversed_num = 0\noriginal_num = num # Store the original number for display\n\n# This loop works for positive numbers\nwhile num > 0:\n    # Get the last digit of the number\n    digit = num % 10\n    \n    # Append the digit to the reversed number\n    reversed_num = (reversed_num * 10) + digit\n    \n    # Remove the last digit from the number\n    num = num // 10\n\nprint(f\"The reverse of {original_num} is: {reversed_num}\")\n```\n\n**How it works (with `num = 358`):**\n\n*   **Iteration 1:**\n    *   `digit = 358 % 10`  (digit is `8`)\n    *   `reversed_num = (0 * 10) + 8` (reversed_num is `8`)\n    *   `num = 358 // 10` (num is `35`)\n*   **Iteration 2:**\n    *   `digit = 35 % 10`  (digit is `5`)\n    *   `reversed_num = (8 * 10) + 5` (reversed_num is `85`)\n    *   `num = 35 // 10` (num is `3`)\n*   **Iteration 3:**\n    *   `digit = 3 % 10`  (digit is `3`)\n    *   `reversed_num = (85 * 10) + 3` (reversed_num is `853`)\n    *   `num = 3 // 10` (num is `0`)\n*   The loop ends because `num` is no longer greater than `0`.\n\n**Limitation:** As written, this loop only works for positive integers.\n\n---\n\n### 3. A Complete, Robust Function (Recommended)\n\nThis is the best approach for real-world use. It combines the simplicity of the string method with logic to correctly handle positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.\n\n```python\ndef reverse_integer(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses an integer, correctly handling positive, negative, and zero values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle the sign separately\n    sign = -1 if n < 0 else 1\n    \n    # Work with the absolute value of the number\n    n_abs = abs(n)\n    \n    # Reverse the absolute value using the string slicing method\n    reversed_abs = int(str(n_abs)[::-1])\n    \n    # Re-apply the original sign and return the result\n    return sign * reversed_abs\n\n# --- Main part of the script ---\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        # Get input from the user\n        user_input = int(input(\"Enter an integer to reverse: \"))\n        \n        # Call the function and get the reversed number\n        reversed_number = reverse_integer(user_input)\n        \n        print(f\"The original number was: {user_input}\")\n        print(f\"The reversed number is: {reversed_number}\")\n        \n        # --- Some test cases ---\n        print(\"\\n--- Testing with other numbers ---\")\n        print(f\"Reverse of 12345 is {reverse_integer(12345)}\")      # Expected: 54321\n        print(f\"Reverse of -987 is {reverse_integer(-987)}\")        # Expected: -789\n        print(f\"Reverse of 120 is {reverse_integer(120)}\")          # Expected: 21\n        print(f\"Reverse of 0 is {reverse_integer(0)}\")              # Expected: 0\n        print(f\"Reverse of -5 is {reverse_integer(-5)}\")            # Expected: -5\n\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\")\n\n```\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n1.  **Handles Negative Numbers:** It checks if the number is negative, reverses the positive version, and then adds the negative sign back at the end.\n2.  **Handles Zero:** It works correctly for `0`.\n3.  **Reusable:** It's wrapped in a function `reverse_integer()`, so you can easily call it multiple times in your code.\n4.  **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block gracefully handles cases where the user enters non-numeric text (e.g., \"hello\")."

    "user": "create a terraform for simple s3 bucket",
    "bot": "Of course! Here is a simple but robust Terraform configuration for creating a private S3 bucket.\n\nThis example is more than the absolute minimum. It includes best practices like:\n*   **Unique Naming:** S3 bucket names must be globally unique. This code uses a random suffix to avoid naming conflicts.\n*   **Explicitly Private:** It includes a resource to block all public access, which is the secure default you should always start with.\n*   **Versioning:** Enabled to protect against accidental deletion or overwrites.\n*   **Tagging:** For organization and cost tracking.\n*   **Variable-driven:** To make the code reusable.\n\n### Directory Structure\n\nFor a clean setup, organize your files like this:\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.tf\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 outputs.tf\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 variables.tf\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 versions.tf\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. `versions.tf`\n\nThis file locks the versions of the providers you're using. This is a crucial best practice to ensure your configuration doesn't break when a new provider version is released.\n\n```hcl\n# versions.tf\n\nterraform {\n  required_providers {\n    aws = {\n      source  = \"hashicorp/aws\"\n      version = \"~> 5.0\"\n    }\n    random = {\n      source  = \"hashicorp/random\"\n      version = \"~> 3.5\"\n    }\n  }\n\n  required_version = \">= 1.3\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. `variables.tf`\n\nThis file defines the input variables for your configuration, making it easy to customize without changing the core logic.\n\n```hcl\n# variables.tf\n\nvariable \"aws_region\" {\n  description = \"The AWS region to create resources in.\"\n  type        = string\n  default     = \"us-east-1\"\n}\n\nvariable \"bucket_prefix\" {\n  description = \"A prefix for the S3 bucket name. A random suffix will be added.\"\n  type        = string\n  default     = \"my-tf-app-bucket\"\n}\n\nvariable \"tags\" {\n  description = \"A map of tags to assign to the bucket.\"\n  type        = map(string)\n  default = {\n    \"ManagedBy\" = \"Terraform\"\n    \"Project\"   = \"MyApp\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. `main.tf`\n\nThis is the main file that defines the resources to be created.\n\n```hcl\n# main.tf\n\n# Configure the AWS Provider\nprovider \"aws\" {\n  region = var.aws_region\n}\n\n# Generate a random string to ensure the bucket name is unique\nresource \"random_string\" \"suffix\" {\n  length  = 8\n  special = false\n  upper   = false\n}\n\n# Create the S3 bucket\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"this\" {\n  # Bucket name is a combination of the prefix and the random string\n  bucket = \"${var.bucket_prefix}-${random_string.suffix.result}\"\n\n  tags = var.tags\n}\n\n# Enable versioning on the S3 bucket\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket_versioning\" \"this\" {\n  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.this.id\n\n  versioning_configuration {\n    status = \"Enabled\"\n  }\n}\n\n# Block all public access to the S3 bucket\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block\" \"this\" {\n  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.this.id\n\n  block_public_acls       = true\n  block_public_policy     = true\n  ignore_public_acls      = true\n  restrict_public_buckets = true\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. `outputs.tf`\n\nThis file declares the output values that will be displayed after Terraform applies the changes. This is useful for getting information about the resources you've created, like the final bucket name.\n\n```hcl\n# outputs.tf\n\noutput \"bucket_name\" {\n  description = \"The globally unique name of the S3 bucket.\"\n  value       = aws_s3_bucket.this.id\n}\n\noutput \"bucket_arn\" {\n  description = \"The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the S3 bucket.\"\n  value       = aws_s3_bucket.this.arn\n}\n\noutput \"bucket_region\" {\n  description = \"The AWS region the S3 bucket was created in.\"\n  value       = aws_s3_bucket.this.region\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### How to Use This Configuration\n\n1.  **Prerequisites:**\n    *   Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).\n    *   Configure your [AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) for Terraform to use.\n\n2.  **Save the Files:** Create the four files (`versions.tf`, `variables.tf`, `main.tf`, `outputs.tf`) in a new directory.\n\n3.  **Initialize Terraform:** Open your terminal in that directory and run:\n    ```sh\n    terraform init\n    ```\n    This command downloads the necessary provider plugins (`aws` and `random`).\n\n4.  **Plan the Changes:** See what Terraform intends to create:\n    ```sh\n    terraform plan\n    ```\n    This will show you that it plans to create 4 resources: the random string, the S3 bucket, the versioning configuration, and the public access block.\n\n5.  **Apply the Changes:** To create the S3 bucket, run:\n    ```sh\n    terraform apply\n    ```\n    Terraform will ask for confirmation. Type `yes` and press Enter.\n\nAfter it's finished, you will see the outputs defined in `outputs.tf`, showing you the final name and ARN of your new S3 bucket.\n\n### To Destroy the Resources\n\nWhen you no longer need the bucket, you can destroy all the resources created by this configuration with a single command:\n```sh\nterraform destroy\n```"

This signals a massive shift in how Indians consume content, largely driven by cheap data and smartphone penetration.\n2.  **A Split Monopoly:** Unlike the previous cycle where Star India held all rights, the current deal is split between two rivals: Disney Star (TV) and Viacom18 (Digital). This has created intense competition for viewership.\n3.  **Aggressive Strategy by Viacom18:** Viacom18's decision to stream the IPL for **free** on its JioCinema app was a game-changing move to capture the digital market and build a massive user base.\n\n---\n\n### Why is the IPL Broadcasting Value So High?\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the IPL's incredible valuation:\n\n*   **Massive Viewership:** The IPL attracts an unparalleled audience. The 2023 season recorded a cumulative TV viewership of over **505 million** and a staggering **449 million** viewers on JioCinema.\n*   **Prime Time Gold:** The IPL matches are scheduled during India's prime time (7:30 PM onwards), making it a must-buy for advertisers wanting to reach the entire family.\n*   **Young Demographics:** India has a vast, young population that is highly engaged with cricket and digital platforms, a demographic that advertisers covet.\n*   **The Digital Revolution:** The proliferation of affordable 4G/5G data and smartphones has made high-quality streaming accessible to hundreds of millions of people, even in rural areas.\n*   **Intense Advertiser Demand:** The IPL is the single biggest marketing event of the year in India. Brands from e-commerce, fintech, auto, and FMCG sectors line up to spend huge amounts on advertising.\n*   **Scarcity and Prestige:** There is only one IPL. Owning its rights provides a media company with unmatched prestige and a guaranteed audience for two months every year.\n\n---\n\n### Historical Growth of IPL Media Rights\n\nThe growth trajectory has been exponential, highlighting the league's incredible success story.\n\n*   **Cycle 1 (2008-2017):**\n    *   **Winner:** Sony Pictures Network\n    *   **Value:** \u20b98,200 crores for 10 years.\n    *   **Per Year Value:** \u20b9820 crores.\n\n*   **Cycle 2 (2018-2022):**\n    *   **Winner:** Star India (consolidated TV and Digital bid)\n    *   **Value:** \u20b916,347.5 crores for 5 years.\n    *   **Per Year Value:** \u20b93,269.5 crores (a ~300% increase from the previous cycle).\n\n*   **Cycle 3 (2023-2027):**\n    *   **Winner:** Disney Star (TV) & Viacom18 (Digital)\n    *   **Value:** \u20b948,390 crores for 5 years.\n    *   **Per Year Value:** \u20b99,678 crores (a ~196% increase from the previous cycle).\n\n### How is the Revenue Shared?\n\nThe media rights revenue is the financial backbone of the IPL. The BCCI shares a significant portion of this central revenue pool with the 10 franchises. While the exact formula can be complex, it's generally understood to be close to a **50:50 split** between the BCCI and the franchises, which is then distributed among the teams. This guaranteed income makes owning an IPL franchise a very profitable venture."

The slice `[::-1]` creates a reversed copy of the string.\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n  \"\"\"\n  Checks if a string is a palindrome using slicing.\n  This version is case-sensitive and considers spaces/punctuation.\n  \"\"\"\n  return s == s[::-1]\n\n# --- Examples ---\nprint(f\"'racecar' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome('racecar')}\")  # True\nprint(f\"'hello' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome('hello')}\")      # False\nprint(f\"'madam' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome('madam')}\")      # True\n\n# Note the limitations of this simple version:\nprint(f\"'Racecar' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome('Racecar')}\")  # False (due to case)\nprint(f\"'taco cat' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome('taco cat')}\") # False (due to space)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Method 2: The Complete & Robust Solution (Handling Case and Punctuation)\n\nFor real-world use (like checking phrases), you need to ignore capitalization, spaces, and punctuation. This function first cleans the string and then performs the check.\n\n**How it works:**\n1.  Create a new string containing only alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) from the original string.\n2.  Convert this new string to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase).\n3.  Use the slicing method from above to check if the cleaned string is a palindrome.\n\n```python\nimport string # Used for punctuation\n\ndef is_palindrome_advanced(s):\n  \"\"\"\n  Checks if a string is a palindrome, ignoring case, spaces, and punctuation.\n  This is the most robust version.\n  \"\"\"\n  # 1. Build a new string with only alphanumeric characters\n  #    and convert to lowercase.\n  cleaned_s = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())\n  \n  # 2. Check if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse\n  return cleaned_s == cleaned_s[::-1]\n\n# --- Examples ---\nprint(f\"'A man, a plan, a canal: Panama' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome_advanced('A man, a plan, a canal: Panama')}\") # True\nprint(f\"'Taco Cat' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome_advanced('Taco Cat')}\")                                      # True\nprint(f\"'No 'x' in Nixon' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome_advanced('No \\'x\\' in Nixon')}\")                         # True\nprint(f\"'hello world' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome_advanced('hello world')}\")                               # False\n```\n\n---\n\n### Method 3: Using a Loop (A More Traditional Approach)\n\nThis method manually reverses the string using a `for` loop. It's great for understanding the underlying logic if you're new to programming.\n\n**How it works:**\n1.  Create an empty string, `reversed_s`.\n2.  Loop through the original string `s` from beginning to end.\n3.  In each iteration, add the current character to the *beginning* of `reversed_s`.\n4.  After the loop, compare `s` with `reversed_s`.\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome_loop(s):\n  \"\"\"\n  Checks if a string is a palindrome using a for loop.\n  (Also case-sensitive and considers spaces)\n  \"\"\"\n  reversed_s = ''\n  for char in s:\n    reversed_s = char + reversed_s  # Prepend the character\n  \n  return s == reversed_s\n\n# --- Examples ---\nprint(f\"'level' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome_loop('level')}\") # True\nprint(f\"'python' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome_loop('python')}\") # False\n```\n\n---\n\n### Method 4: Using Two Pointers (For Performance)\n\nThis is an efficient method because it avoids creating a new reversed string, saving memory. It's a common technique asked about in technical interviews.\n\n**How it works:**\n1.  Set two \"pointers\": `left` at the start of the string and `right` at the end.\n2.  Use a `while` loop to continue as long as `left` is less than `right`.\n3.  In each iteration, compare the characters at the `left` and `right` pointers.\n4.  If they are not the same, the string is not a palindrome, so return `False` immediately.\n5.  If they are the same, move the pointers closer to the center (`left` moves right, `right` moves left).\n6.  If the loop finishes without finding any mismatches, the string is a palindrome, so return `True`.\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome_pointers(s):\n  \"\"\"\n  Checks if a string is a palindrome using the two-pointer method.\n  (Also case-sensitive and considers spaces)\n  \"\"\"\n  left = 0\n  right = len(s) - 1\n  \n  while left < right:\n    if s[left] != s[right]:\n      return False\n    left += 1\n    right -= 1\n    \n  return True\n\n# --- Examples ---\nprint(f\"'kayak' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome_pointers('kayak')}\") # True\nprint(f\"'world' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome_pointers('world')}\") # False\n```\n\n### Checking for Palindromic Numbers\n\nThe same logic applies to numbers. You just need to convert the number to a string first.\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome_number(num):\n  \"\"\"Checks if a number is a palindrome.\"\"\"\n  # Convert the number to a string and use the simple slicing method\n  return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]\n\n# --- Examples ---\nprint(f\"121 is a palindrome: {is_palindrome_number(121)}\")       # True\nprint(f\"12321 is a palindrome: {is_palindrome_number(12321)}\")   # True\nprint(f\"12345 is a palindrome: {is_palindrome_number(12345)}\")   # False\n```"

The \"best possible method\" in Terraform avoids hardcoding, promotes reusability, and follows security best practices.\n\nThis solution uses separate files for clarity, dynamically finds the latest Amazon Linux AMI, and uses variables for all configurable parameters. This is a production-ready pattern.\n\n### Directory Structure\n\nCreate a new directory for your project and place these files inside it:\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.tf\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 variables.tf\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 outputs.tf\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 terraform.tfvars\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. `variables.tf`\n\nThis file defines the input variables for our configuration, acting as the \"API\" for our module.\n\n```terraform\n# variables.tf\n\nvariable \"aws_region\" {\n  description = \"The AWS region to create resources in.\"\n  type        = string\n  default     = \"us-east-1\"\n}\n\nvariable \"instance_type\" {\n  description = \"The EC2 instance type.\"\n  type        = string\n  default     = \"t3.micro\"\n}\n\nvariable \"instance_name\" {\n  description = \"The name tag for the EC2 instance.\"\n  type        = string\n  default     = \"WebApp-Server\"\n}\n\nvariable \"key_pair_name\" {\n  description = \"The name of the AWS key pair to use for SSH access.

Change it for production.\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. `main.tf`\n\nThis is the core file that defines the resources to be created.\n\n```terraform\n# main.tf\n\nprovider \"aws\" {\n  region = var.aws_region\n}\n\n# Data source to get the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI ID\ndata \"aws_ami\" \"amazon_linux_2\" {\n  most_recent = true\n  owners      = [\"amazon\"]\n\n  filter {\n    name   = \"name\"\n    values = [\"amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2\"]\n  }\n\n  filter {\n    name   = \"virtualization-type\"\n    values = [\"hvm\"]\n  }\n}\n\n# Define the security group for the EC2 instance\nresource \"aws_security_group\" \"web_sg\" {\n  name        = \"${var.instance_name}-sg\"\n  description = \"Allow HTTP and SSH traffic\"\n\n  ingress {\n    from_port   = 22\n    to_port     = 22\n    protocol    = \"tcp\"\n    cidr_blocks = [var.ssh_location]\n    description = \"Allow SSH access\"\n  }\n\n  ingress {\n    from_port   = 80\n    to_port     = 80\n    protocol    = \"tcp\"\n    cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]\n    description = \"Allow HTTP access from anywhere\"\n  }\n\n  egress {\n    from_port   = 0\n    to_port     = 0\n    protocol    = \"-1\" # Allow all outbound traffic\n    cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]\n  }\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"${var.instance_name}-sg\"\n  }\n}\n\n# Define the EC2 instance itself\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"web_server\" {\n  ami           = data.aws_ami.amazon_linux_2.id\n  instance_type = var.instance_type\n  key_name      = var.key_pair_name\n\n  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web_sg.id]\n\n  # User data script to install and start an Apache web server\n  user_data = <<-EOF\n              #!/bin/bash\n              yum update -y\n              yum install -y httpd\n              systemctl start httpd\n              systemctl enable httpd\n              echo \"<h1>Hello from Terraform!</h1>\" > /var/www/html/index.html\n              EOF\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = var.instance_name\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. `outputs.tf`\n\nThis file declares the output values you want to see after Terraform applies the configuration.\n\n```terraform\n# outputs.tf\n\noutput \"instance_id\" {\n  description = \"The ID of the created EC2 instance.\"\n  value       = aws_instance.web_server.id\n}\n\noutput \"instance_public_ip\" {\n  description = \"The public IP address of the EC2 instance.\"\n  value       = aws_instance.web_server.public_ip\n}\n\noutput \"instance_public_dns\" {\n  description = \"The public DNS name of the EC2 instance.\"\n  value       = aws_instance.web_server.public_dns\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. `terraform.tfvars`\n\nThis file is where you provide your specific values for the variables. **Do not commit this file to public version control if it contains sensitive information.**\n\n```hcl\n# terraform.tfvars\n\naws_region    = \"us-east-1\"\ninstance_type = \"t3.micro\"\nkey_pair_name = \"my-aws-key-pair\" # <--- IMPORTANT: Change this to your key pair name\nssh_location  = \"YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/32\" # <--- IMPORTANT: Change this to your public IP address\n```\n\nTo find your public IP, you can google \"what is my ip\".\n\n### How to Use\n\n1.  **Prerequisites**:\n    *   Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).\n    *   Configure your [AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).\n    *   Create an [AWS EC2 Key Pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in the AWS console and update `terraform.tfvars` with its name.\n\n2.  **Initialize**: Open your terminal in the project directory and run:\n    ```bash\n    terraform init\n    ```\n\n3.  **Plan**: See what resources Terraform will create:\n    ```bash\n    terraform plan\n    ```\n\n4.  **Apply**: Create the resources:\n    ```bash\n    terraform apply\n    ```\n    Type `yes` when prompted. After it finishes, Terraform will print the public IP and DNS name from the `outputs.tf` file.\n\n5.  **Destroy**: To clean up and delete all created resources:\n    ```bash\n    terraform destroy\n    ```\n\n### Why This is the Best Method\n\n*   **Modular & Reusable**: By using variables (`variables.tf`), you can reuse this same code for different environments (dev, prod) just by changing the `terraform.tfvars` file.\n*   **Dynamic AMI**: `data \"aws_ami\"` ensures you always get the latest, patched version of Amazon Linux 2 without manually updating the AMI ID, which is region-specific and changes over time.\n*   **Security Best Practices**:\n    *   It creates a **dedicated security group** instead of using the default one.\n    *   It follows the **principle of least privilege**, only opening necessary ports (22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP).\n    *   It forces you to restrict SSH access to a specific IP (`ssh_location`), which is a critical security measure.\n*   **Clear Outputs**: The `outputs.tf` file makes it easy to get essential information like the instance's public IP without having to search for it in the AWS console.\n*   **Automated Configuration**: `user_data` automatically configures the instance on boot, making the setup repeatable and hands-off.\n*   **Clean and Maintainable**: Separating concerns into `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` makes the code much easier to read, understand, and maintain as it grows."
